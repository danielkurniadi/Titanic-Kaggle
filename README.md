# Titanic-Kaggle
The Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg and shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships. 
In this challenge, kagglers complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive and apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.
